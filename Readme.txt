HLExtract Usage:
================

Correct HLExtract usage:
 -p <filepath>       (Package to load.)
 -d <path>           (Destination extraction directory.)
 -e <itempath>       (Item in package to extract.)
 -t <itempath>       (Item in package to validate.)
 -l[d][f] [filepath] (List the contents of the package.)
 -f                  (Defragment package.)
 -c                  (Console mode.)
 -s                  (Silent mode.)
 -m                  (Use file mapping.)
 -q                  (Use quick file mapping.)
 -v                  (Allow volatile access.)
 -o                  (Don't overwrite files.)
 -r                  (Force defragmenting on all files.)
 -n <path>           (NCF file's root path.)

Example HLExtract usage:
HLExtract.exe -p "C:\half-life.gcf" -d "C:\backup" -e "root\valve\models" -e "root\valve\config.cfg"
HLExtract.exe -p "C:\half-life.gcf" -c -m -q -v
HLExtract.exe -p "C:\half-life.gcf" -lf "C:\half-life.txt" -m -s
HLExtract.exe -p "C:\half-life.gcf" -m -f

  dir [filter]		Directory listing.
  cd <folder>		Change directory to <folder>.
  info <item>		Information on <item>.
  extract <item>	Extract <item> to <path> specified by -d.
